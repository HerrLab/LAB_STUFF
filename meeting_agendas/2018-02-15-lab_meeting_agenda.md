#2018-02-15 lab meeting

1. Loren visits - everyone does elevator talk
2. Lab renovation - Kevin from Barry's group
3. Chemical Inventory (required by EHS) - can we all do it? Scheduled time or just one at a time? When shelves go up?
4. Today - everyone should be there - Lan House food - We are responsible for cleaning up after the dinner, taking down tables, and tidying up the lobby.
5. Corn microbiome and soybean microbiome samples - Hops too? Orchard leaves? Plenty of kits to be used.
6. Help me with the talk?
