# Meeting Agenda for September 14th, 2017

## Stuff:

## Restructuring our individual meetings

Moving from 1/2 hour slots to one hour times? Let's work out the schedule! It's become evident that we need more time to discuss things.

## Greenhouse and Greenhouse Training

Greenhouse training: Friday morning (September 15th), 10 am in Plant Sciences Hall Room 274, no need to register, but you have to be certified to use the greenhouse. There is a training at 9 am on the same day and place if you can't attend with the lab.
