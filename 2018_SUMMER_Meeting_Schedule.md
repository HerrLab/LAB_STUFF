# SUMMER 2018 Meeting Extravaganza!

## LAB MEETING & EVENT CALENDAR

__Lab meeting location: PLANT SCIENCES ROOM 375.__

Since we're really busy this summer, we'll try to keep lab meeting to two hours and have a brief overview from everyone and then one person will present in preparation for summer presentations.

There will be no lab events from July 14th until August 10th due to the IMA and ICPP meetings.

~~May 30th is the professional workshop so we won't have lab meeting that week~~

Also, I'm going to try to have regular bonfire - backyard movie nights if everyone is interested. First up, since a lot of you haven't seen the movie, is "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"!

Pippette and lab olympics?

## __Individual Meetings__

We'll meet every Tuesdays for summer. We can meet in my office in 422 Plant Science Hall unless you would like to meet elsewhere. Let me know if this time no longer works for you or if you have to be away for a specific week.
