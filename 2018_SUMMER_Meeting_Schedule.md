There will be no lab events from July 14th until August 10th due to the IMA and ICPP meetings.

May 30th is the professional workshop so we won't have lab meeting that week

Also, I'm going to try to have regular bonfire - backyard movie nights if everyone is interested. First up, since a lot of you haven't seen the movie, is "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"!

Thirsty Thursdays at the SaltDogs!

Pippette and lab olympics

## __Individual Meetings__

We'll alternate meeting on Tuesdays for one hour each like last semester. We can meet in my office in 422 Plant Science Hall unless you would like to meet elsewhere. We will take a break for spring break week, but I will be here for specific meetings. Let me know if this time no longer works for you or if you have to be away for a specific week.
