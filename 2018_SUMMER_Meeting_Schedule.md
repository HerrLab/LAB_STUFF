There will be no lab events from July 14th until August 10th due to the IMA and ICPP meetings.

May 30th is the professional workshop so we won't have lab meeting that week

Also, I'm going to try to have regular bonfire - backyard movie nights if everyone is interested. First up, since a lot of you haven't seen the movie, is "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"!

Thirsty Thursdays at the SaltDogs!

Pippette and lab olympics
