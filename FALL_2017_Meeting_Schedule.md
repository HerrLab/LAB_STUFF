# This is a file to schedule weekly lab meetings and discussions

[It looks like](http://whenisgood.net/akrkr3e/results/qkqsztz) everyone is free on Tuesday and Thursday in the morning, so we'll go from there.  I'm proposing the following meeting schedule:

## __TUESDAYS__

Fill in which time you would like to meet with me weekly (you are all free during all of these times, so it's first come first serve!) :

** Tuesday Time **|** PERSON **
:-----:|:-----:
9:00 am | Josh (fill in your name below just like this)
10:00 am | Timothy
10:30 am | Erin
11:00 am |
11:30 am | Eddie
1:00 pm | Thais
1:30 pm |

Meetings will eventually take place in my new office on East Campus (more on that when I can move into the space), so let's plan on meeting at Cultiva on East Campus until further notice.


## __THURSDAYS__

__Lab meeting: PLANT SCIENCES ROOM 406 (Plant Pathology Department Conference Room) at 10 am.__

This will be formal presentations (or a journal club, waiting to hear back from Margaret) and lab discussions. The following schedule is still in effect, now updated. Feel free to claim a week and/or a topic you want to discuss. I'll assign and move forward.
