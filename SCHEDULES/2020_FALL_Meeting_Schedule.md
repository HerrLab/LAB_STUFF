# FALL 2020 LAB MEETING SCHEDULE EXTRAVAGANZA!

## __LAB MEETING__

__Lab meeting: After our discussion, we'll just plan to meet in our Managed Ecosystems Working Group meeting - We'll still meet (most) weeks on Friday at 2 pm in Keim Hall 264. We'll try to keep business to the first few minutes, but then the most of the meeting will be on the topic of the week. Since we are busy, we'll try to keep lab meeting to one hour.__
